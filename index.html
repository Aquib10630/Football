                    Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain in a move worth €222 million, making him the most
                    expensive player ever.[note 1] In France, Neymar won three league titles, three Coupe de France, and

                    a German professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Süper Lig club Fenerbahçe.
                    Nicknamed "The Assist King",[2][3][4][5][6][7] Özil is known for his technical skills, creativity,
                    agility, and finesse.[8] He has also played as a wide midfielder in his career.

                    Born and raised in Gelsenkirchen, Özil began his senior club career playing for hometown club
                    Schalke 04, before signing with Werder Bremen in 2008, aged 19. After winning the DFB-Pokal in his

                    Salah started his senior career with Egyptian club Al Mokawloon, departing shortly thereafter to
                    join Swiss side Basel for an undisclosed fee. In Switzerland, his performances attracted Premier

                    sparingly in his debut season and was allowed to leave on loan to Serie A clubs Fiorentina and Roma,
                    with the latter eventually signing him permanently for €15 million. Following his role in helping

                <h1>Kevin De Bruyne</h1>
                <p>Kevin De Bruyne (born 28 June 1991) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder
                    for Premier League club Manchester City, where he is vice-captain, and the Belgium national team. He
                    is one of just three players (the others being Cristiano Ronaldo and Thierry Henry) to have won the
                    PFA Players' Player of the Year award back to back, and the only midfielder and Belgium player to
                    have done so in English football history.[5]

                    De Bruyne began his career at Genk, where he was a regular player when they won the 2010–11 Belgian
                    Pro League. In 2012, he joined English club Chelsea, where he was used sparingly and then loaned to
                    Werder Bremen. He signed with Wolfsburg for £18 million in 2014, where he established himself as one
                    of the best players in the Bundesliga and was integral in the club's 2014–15 DFB-Pokal win. In the
                    summer of 2015, De Bruyne joined Manchester City for a club record £54 million. He has since won
                    three Premier League titles, five League Cups and an FA Cup with the club. In 2017–18, he had a
                    significant role in Manchester City's record in becoming the only Premier League team to attain 100
                    points in a single season. In 2019–20, De Bruyne tied the record for most assists in a Premier
                    League season and was awarded Player of the Season.</p>

                <h1>Philippe Coutinho</h1>
                <p>Philippe Coutinho Correia (born 12 June 1992) is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as an
                    attacking midfielder or winger for Spanish club Barcelona and the Brazil national team. He is known
                    for his combination of vision, passing, dribbling and ability to conjure curving long-range
                    strikes.[4]

                    Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Coutinho showed prodigious talent and excelled in Vasco da Gama's
                    youth system. He was signed by Italian club Inter Milan in 2008 for €4 million and subsequently
                    loaned back to Vasco, where he became a key player. He made his debut for Inter Milan in 2010, and
                    was later loaned to La Liga club Espanyol in 2012. In January 2013, Coutinho joined English club
                    Liverpool for £8.5 million. He flourished at Liverpool, being named in the PFA Team of the Year in
                    2015.[5][6] In January 2018, Coutinho signed for Barcelona for a club record fee reportedly worth
                    €160 million (making him the world's second most expensive player at the time),[7] and won two La
                    Liga titles. However, he was loaned to German club Bayern Munich on a season-long loan ahead of the
                    2019–20 season, being a part of the team that won a treble including the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and
                    UEFA Champions League.[8]</p>

                    from North America and Asia have also been invited to compete.
